# PIKALK #

This program was written back in 2002 using Turbo Pascal to approximate the value of Pi, by calculating the circumference of inscribed and circumscribed polygons of a circle.

The file was originally encoded in MS-DOS Code Page 437, and has been converted to UTF-8 in order to preserve readability.

You can use [Free Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org "Free Pascal") to compile and run it.
